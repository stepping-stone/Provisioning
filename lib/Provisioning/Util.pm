=head2 getHomeDir()

This method calculates form the userID the corresponding home directory. this would be /var/backup/%last-digit%/%three-last-digit%/%digit2-to-digit-4%/%userID/ where digit refers to the userID. So the home directory for the user 1234567 would be: /var/backup/7/567/234/1234567. This method returns the calculated home directory and takes as input-parameter the userID.
